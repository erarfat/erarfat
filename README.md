# 👋 Hi, I'm Arfat Shaikh | DevOps Engineer 🚀  

## 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile  

I'm **Arfat Shaikh**, a results-driven **DevOps Engineer** passionate about building reliable, scalable, and automated cloud infrastructures.  

I specialize in **Cloud Computing**, **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, and **Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD)** — empowering teams to deliver faster and more securely.  
My expertise spans **AWS**, **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes**, with a strong focus on automating deployments and managing microservices at scale.  

I’m deeply interested in **container orchestration**, **pipeline optimization**, and **cloud-native solutions** that enhance system performance and resilience.  
By combining **automation**, **observability**, and **collaboration**, I strive to bridge the gap between **development** and **operations** — creating seamless, efficient, and secure delivery workflows.  

🚀 I enjoy solving complex infrastructure challenges, optimizing resources, and designing DevOps solutions that bring innovation to life.
